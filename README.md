# AWS-Amplify-and-React-Component-Overrides

This article refers to the Figma, AWS Amplify Studio generated UI-Components and VSCode. In this instance I am using the component ContactUs.
The file contact.js uses the ui-component ContactUs and overrides many of its props. The purpose of this repo is just to illustrate how to
use the overrides syntax effectively.
